# Artificial Neural Network

# Importing the libraries
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import tensorflow as tf
tf.__version__

# Part 1 - Data Preprocessing

# Importing the dataset
dataset = pd.read_csv('Churn_Modelling.csv')
#trim off the rownumber customer id and surname, those are not predictive
X = dataset.iloc[:, 3:-1].values
y = dataset.iloc[:, -1].values
print(X)
print(y)

# Encoding categorical data
# Label Encoding the "Gender" column
from sklearn.preprocessing import LabelEncoder
le = LabelEncoder()
X[:, 2] = le.fit_transform(X[:, 2])
print(X)
# One Hot Encoding the "Geography" column
from sklearn.compose import ColumnTransformer
from sklearn.preprocessing import OneHotEncoder
#transform the column that we want to make onehot encoded --> geography
ct = ColumnTransformer(transformers=[('encoder', OneHotEncoder(), [1])], remainder='passthrough')
#use the columntransformer to change the matrix of features
X = np.array(ct.fit_transform(X))
print(X)

# Splitting the dataset into the Training set and Test set
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size = 0.2, random_state = 0)

# Feature Scaling
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
sc = StandardScaler()
X_train = sc.fit_transform(X_train)
X_test = sc.transform(X_test)

# Part 2 - Building the ANN

# Initializing the ANN
ann = tf.keras.models.Sequential()

# Adding the input layer and the first hidden layer
ann.add(tf.keras.layers.Dense(units=6, activation='relu'))

# Adding the second hidden layer
ann.add(tf.keras.layers.Dense(units=6, activation='relu'))

# Adding the output layer
# only a single neuron is needed to say yes/no
# two neurons would be needed
# sigmoid activation allows probabilities that binary outcome is one (leaves bank)
ann.add(tf.keras.layers.Dense(units=1, activation='sigmoid'))

# Part 3 - Training the ANN

# Compiling the ANN
# adam optimizer updates the weights stochastically
# binary_crossentropy for binary classification
# categorical crossentropy is for classifying multiple categories
# metrics is list of metrics to evaluate ANN during training
ann.compile(optimizer = 'adam', loss = 'binary_crossentropy', metrics = ['accuracy'])

# Training the ANN on the Training set
# batch size is the number of predictions in batch to be compared to same number of real results
ann.fit(X_train, y_train, batch_size = 32, epochs = 100)

# Part 4 - Making the predictions and evaluating the model

# Predicting the result of a single observation

Homework:
Use our ANN model to predict if the customer with the following informations will leave the bank: 
Geography: France
Credit Score: 600
Gender: Male
Age: 40 years old
Tenure: 3 years
Balance: $ 60000
Number of Products: 2
Does this customer have a credit card? Yes
Is this customer an Active Member: Yes
Estimated Salary: $ 50000
So, should we say goodbye to that customer?

Solution:
"""
print(X)
#prediction for if this particular customer will leave the bank:
print('Customer will leave bank:')
#input must be in 2D array for predict method [[ ]]
# predict method should be called on observatiosn that are scaled the same way as the training set
# use sc object to scale the prediction via standardization, only apply transform and not fit because fit will cause information leakage
# sigmoid output provides a probability that the customer will leave the bank
print(ann.predict(sc.transform([[1, 0, 0, 600, 1, 40, 3, 60000, 2, 1, 1, 50000]])))
# if predicated probability is > 50%, then they'll leave the bank
print(ann.predict(sc.transform([[1, 0, 0, 600, 1, 40, 3, 60000, 2, 1, 1, 50000]])) > 0.5)

"""
Therefore, our ANN model predicts that this customer stays in the bank!
Important note 1: Notice that the values of the features were all input in a double pair of square brackets. That's because the "predict" method always expects a 2D array as the format of its inputs. And putting our values into a double pair of square brackets makes the input exactly a 2D array.
Important note 2: Notice also that the "France" country was not input as a string in the last column but as "1, 0, 0" in the first three columns. That's because of course the predict method expects the one-hot-encoded values of the state, and as we see in the first row of the matrix of features X, "France" was encoded as "1, 0, 0". And be careful to include these values in the first three columns, because the dummy variables are always created in the first columns.
